# HaxeFlixel Multi-Window POC

## Setup

You will need a hashlink or other sys target to run this on. I use HL mostly so hence commands below.

```
git clone https://github.com/47rooks/multi-window.git

cd multi-window

haxelib newrepo
haxelib install lime
haxelib install openfl
haxelib install flixel

lime test hl
```
